# Deep-learning-Automatic-Music-Transcription
This repository contains the research done and the codes written for the semester project - Automatic Music Transcription, offered by Electronics Club IIT Kanpur, and mentored by me.   
1. We have explored various models, for example, CNN, RNN and models with the combination of two, with a sole motive of achieveing maximum accuracy. 
2. For preprocessing of the music files, we have tried various ways, for example, `constant Q- transform`, `Short- time fourier transform`, and `mel-frequency cepstrum`, and have compared the results with respect to the model used. 
3. Each folder in this repository represents a different model trained for automatic music transcription. 
4. We will keep on updating the repository until we arrive at the end dates of the projects.  

Till then, stay tuned.
